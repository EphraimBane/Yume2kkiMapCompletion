# Yume2kkiMapCompletion
This program will tell you which maps are missing from your map completion rate on Yume 2kki.

I made this repo so you could find it on google so that it can reach more people than those who ask for it on YNOCord

This is a command line script and it requires beautifulsoup4 (if you have python it should be "python -m pip install bs4" or "pip3 install bs4")

"maps.txt" is a file containing a list of every accessible map ID, I know it should probably be a list of inaccessible maps instead but if you want to update it for the new versions just append any newly added map IDs to the file

The maplist was made for game version 0.120 and then half-assedly updated for 0.120c or whatever it says at the top. It will probably be inaccurate by the time you find this script.

sorry this readme sucks it's late at night and I'm tired
